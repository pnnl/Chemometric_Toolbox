function Y = pnnl_normalize_rows(X)
    % pnnl_normalize_rows Normalize the rows of a matrix.
    %
    %   Y = pnnl_normalize_rows(X) normalizes each row of X by the 2-norm
    %   of that row, so that the norm of each nonzero row of Y is one.
    %
    %   Example:
    %
    %     X = [1, 2, -3;-6, 5, 4;7, -9, 8]
    %     Y = pnnl_normalize_rows(X)
    %     norm(Y(1,:))
    %     norm(Y(2,:))
    %     norm(Y(3,:))

    Y = zeros(size(X));
    for k = 1:size(X,1)
        Y(k,:) = X(k,:)/norm(X(k,:));
